# vuex-models

This package is aims to simplify `v-model` usage with your vuex state, by providing `getter/action/mutation/state` generator and mapper, that generates `v-model` compatible computed properties.

## Installation

Just use npm:

`npm i --save vuex-models`

## Usage

Using vuex-models is a dead simple - first you need to generate store fields like this:

```js
// your imports
import { genVuexModels } from 'vuex-models'

// Vue.use(Vuex), etc

/*
  First argument is an array of generated field names
  Second optional argument - state attribute name,
  where generated fields will be stored their states
  ===
    From 1.0.2 added handy support to create models with initial state.
    Just use `genVuexModels` with object instead array, as follow:
  ===
*/
// models with initial state values
const models = genVuexModels({
  foo: 'bar'
}, 'baz')

const store = new Vuex.Store({
  ...models
});

/*
  OLD WAY! Do not use it at new code!
  Before 1.0.2 state was empty object with namespace, so it was
  your responsibility to manually create initial state
*/
const { mutations, actions, getters, state } = genVuexModels([
  'foo'
], 'bar');

const oldWayStore = new Vuex.Store({
  mutations,
  actions,
  getters,
  state
});

export default store
```

Then, in your vue components you can map computed properties by using `mapVuexModels`:

```js
import { mapVuexModels } from 'vuex-models'

export default {
  computed: {
    /*
      creating computed properties:
      foo: {
        get () { return this.$store.getters.autogeneratedGetterFoo },
        set (val) { this.$store.dispatch('autogeneratedAction', val) }
      }

      so, from now, you can safely use `foo` in v-model directives
    */
    ...mapVuexModels([
      'foo'
    ])
  }
}
```

## Vuex namespaced stores

Also you can use `vuex-models` for namespaced vuex modules. All you need is to pass second argument to `mapVuexModels` with namespace name:

```js
// for example we have store module namespaced with 'MyNamespacedModule'

export default {
  computed: {
    ...mapVuexModels([
      'foo'
    ], 'MyNamespacedModule')
  }
}
```

## Rename computed properties

Like vuex mappers, mapVuexModels supports properties renaming:

```js
export default {
  computed: {
    // this.bar responds to store.foo model
    ...mapVuexModels({
      'bar': 'foo'
    })
  }
}
```
